Steering Wheel Control adapter for aftermarket headunit using an ATTiny85 and a MCP41100 (Ford Focus 2005)

# Intro

This project aims at building an open source steering wheel control adapter for a 2005 Ford Focus and a Sony aftermarket headunit.

It is basically a voltage divisor circuit translator, since both the factory and the aftermarket headunit uses a voltage divisor circuit to communicate the controls.
